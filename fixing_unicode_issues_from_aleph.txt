1)      Open the file in MarcEdit
2)      Do a field edit update. Search LDR for the following: [^\x00-\x7F]+ (checking RegEx) and replace with “Q” since Q should not appear in a LDR anywhere
3)      In MarcEdit, open the Delete Selected MARC Records
4)      set the Display Field as LDR, import the file, then search for “Q”
5)      Delete or export the selected records (depending on your purposes).
