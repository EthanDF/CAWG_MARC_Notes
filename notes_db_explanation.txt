notes_db DB Explainer:

* AlephBibs - 
	contains data about the aleph bib records extracted directly from records downloaded from Aleph - usually report but occassionally production
	- bibNumber (integer) - the MARC 001 field - if no 001 field prints, a generic counter value is used
	- OCN (integer) - the first OCLC number from the MARC 035 value in the Aleph record defined as starting with "(OCoLC)" - if no OCLC number exists for the record, the value is set to -1
	- LDRForm (char(1)) - value extracted from the LDR06
	- Form (char(1)) - form value extracted from the MARC 008
	- GPO (1/0) - equal to 1 if Aleph bib record contains a MARC 040$d = "GPO"
	- gPub (1/0) - equal to 1 if the government pub field value from the MARC 008 is not blank.
	
* altOCLC - 
	contains the relationship between OCLC Numbers and MARC 019 (cancelled OCLC Numbers) as extracted during the reading of OCLC MARC records
	- keyaltoclc (integer) - primary key of table
	- altOCLC (integer) - either the MARC 019 value or the actual oclc number
	- oclc (integer) - the oclc number for the record

* BibNotes - 
	contains data about the MARC 500 record associated with the aleph bib number as extracted from the Aleph Bib records. Each row should have a corresponding row on AlephBibs.
	- keybibNotes (integer) - primary key of table
	- bib (integer) - fk of AlephBibs
	- NoteOrder (integer) - the order of MARC 500 field from the Aleph record. Serves as a uniqueness index.
	- note (text) - the MARC 500 string from the subfield $a of the Aleph record.
	- OwnCodeCount (integer) - the number of subfield $5 values associated with the note.
	- OwnCode (STRING) - only populated when OwnCodeCount is 1 (not enforced on the table). The subfield $5 associated with the MARC 500 field.
	
* DupOCLC - 
	a temporary table designed to identify duplicated rows on oclcNotes.
	- oclc (integer) - fk of oclcNotes
	- notes (text) - the note string
	- count(keyOCLCNotes) (none) - the number of keys found (i.e. how large the duplicated set is)

*FGCU - 
	a temporary table designed to identify the bibNumbers associated with FGCU. Some of the values may not exist on AlephBibs due to a lack of printed MARC 001 value.
	- bibNumber (integer) - fk of alephBibs

*FIU - 
	a temporary table designed to identify the bibNumbers associated with FIU. Some of the values may not exist on AlephBibs due to a lack of printed MARC 001 value.
	- bib (integer) - fk of alephBibs

* FSU_OCLC - 
	a temporary table designed to update AlephBibs with the correct bib number based on a match between the OCLC number on this table and on alephBibs.
	- bib (integer) - fk of FSU 
	- OCLC (integer) - the OCLC number associated with the bib in Aleph

* FSUHoldings -
	a temporary table designed to identify the bibNumbers associated with FSU and associate all AlephBibs for FSU with their sublibrary and collection. 
	- bib (integer) aleph bib number
	- hol (integer) aleph holdings number
	- sublib (char) aleph sublibrary for the holdings number
	- coll (char) aleph collection code for the holdings number

* notesAnalysis - 
	contains the results of comparisons between AlephNotes and OCLCNotes utilizing the fuzzywuzzy near matching ratios.
	- KeyNoteAnalysis (integer) - key of table
	- keybibNotes (integer) - fk of BibNotes
	- keyoclcNotes (integer) - fk of oclcNotes
	- FuzzRatio (integer) - result of fuzz.Ratio
	- ParitialRatio (integer) - result of fuzz.PartialRatio
	- TokenSortRatio (integer) - result of fuzz.TokenSortRatio
	- TokenSetRatio (integer) - result of fuzz.TokenSetRatio

* oclcNotes - 
	contains data about the MARC 500 fields from the OCLC Records downloaded as corresponding to the OCLC numbers on the Aleph Bib records.
	- keyOCLCNotes (integer) - key of the table
	- oclc (integer) - the oclc number for the MARC record from OCLC
	- noteFormOrder (integer) - the order of MARC 500 field from the OCLC record. Serves as a uniqueness index.
	- notes (text) - the MARC 500 string from the subfield $a of the OCLC record.

oclcSans500 - 
	contains OCLC numbers found but that do not have any MARC 500 fields. Needed to return MARC 500 fields from AlephNotes that have no value in notesAnalysis
	- OCN (integer) - the OCLC number found to not have any MARC 500 fields.
